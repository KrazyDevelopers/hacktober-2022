## Word Cloud

## Overview

A `word cloud` is a collection, or cluster, of words depicted in different sizes. The bigger and bolder the word appears, the more often itâ€™s mentioned within a given text and the more important it is. 

### Objective 

Create a program that will open and read `the_raven.txt`, which contains text from _The Raven_ by Edgar Allan Poe, and generate a `wordcloud`, and save the output (_screenshot below_). 


> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: You can replace `the_raven.txt` with a different `.txt` file. Try generating a `wordcloud` from your own favorite poem or short story.
