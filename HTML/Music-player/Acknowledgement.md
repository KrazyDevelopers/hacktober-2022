This project is very basic idea 'bout playing media without fetching it from any of the music websites or webapps.
The code for this webplayer is written by Teddy#6969.
I have watched a tutorial for learning and basic structure about html and js learnt from there only.
So, in case of any eror/issue you can open a a request.
Thanks have fun:)
